- Italo Terto da Silva 21326312

The project as a whole was split down into different modules, in which each group member picked and developed.
In this repo, the AdminPanel for the application was developed.

### Project Idea:

Skill Swap is a project to help all types of people connect and share the specialized skills that they have and need. Instead of searching for expensive consultants, users can simply swap skills with other users in a mutual exchange, saving money, time and fostering reciprocity.

### Assingment Objective:

Developing a high-level architecture for a Research Management System (RMS) is the main objective of this phase.

### Deliverables:

* Select an appropriate architectural style (e.g., Microservices for modularity, MVC for structure, etc).
* Design a component-based frontend with React or similar technology.
* Implement an MVC-based ( or similar) backend with Spring Boot or similar technology for scalability and security.
* Create UML Diagrams: Component Diagram, Deployment Diagram, Sequence Diagram.
* Justify architectural decisions based on scalability, data security, and interoperability.
* Develop a basic prototype using React, Spring Boot or similar technologies.
* A system architecture with React components or an MVC structure will be the outcome of this project phase.
